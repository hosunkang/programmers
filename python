## Qustion
# phone_book	                        return
# ["119", "97674223", "1195524421"]	false
# ["123","456","789"]	              true
# ["12","123","1235","567","88"]	    false

## My solution
def solution(phone_book):
    phone_book.sort()
    for i in range(len(phone_book)):
        if i < len(phone_book)-1:
            if phone_book[i+1].find(phone_book[i]) == 0:
                return False
    return True

## Good solution
def solution(phone_book):
    answer = True
    hash_map = {}
    for phone_number in phone_book:
        hash_map[phone_number] = 1
    for phone_number in phone_book:
        temp = ""
        for number in phone_number:
            temp += number
            if temp in hash_map and temp != phone_number:
                answer = False
    return answer
